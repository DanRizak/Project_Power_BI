# Project_Power_BI
min. 5 different visuals on page, filtering with slicers, measures and calculated columns, data hierarchy, connect multiple data sources

The second project is focused on visualization of the dataset. You can either use your own pre-prepared dataset or use original data sources again.
You can, of course, be inspired by the questions from the first project, but mainly you have to display them graphically in a Power BI report in an appropriate way. Your task is to visualize your chosen dataset according to the criteria specified below.

The final PBI must meet the following criteria:
 Range 2-3 pages
 Using at least 5 different types of visuals
 Filtering with slicers
 Use of bookmarks/page navigation
 Connecting multiple data sources, whether in Power Query or Power BI
 Using a data hierarchy of at least two levels
 Creation of at least 1 measure and 1 calculated column
 Graphic editing of the used visuals and a visually friendly resulting report


Data source used for the Project in Power BI is:
https://www.oiv.int/index.php/what-we-do/statistics - statistics main page,
https://www.oiv.int/what-we-do/data-discovery-report?oiv - table with raw data
